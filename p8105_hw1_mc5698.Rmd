#question 1
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```


The penguin dataset has `r ncol(penguins)` columns and `r nrow(penguins)` rows. There are 8 variables in this dataset include `r names(penguins)`. It records 3 kinds of penguins and they are `r unique(penguins$species)`. They are from different islands include `r unique(penguins$island)`. Their average flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)` mm. 


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plotp = ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
plotp
```
```{r}
ggsave("penguins scatter plot.pdf", plot=plotp)
```


#question 2 
```{r}
df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_char = sample(letters, 10),
  vec_logical = rnorm(10)>0,
  vec_factor = factor(sample(c("level 1", "level 2", "level 3"),10, replace = TRUE))
)
df
```


```{r setup,warning=FALSE}
mean(df%>%pull(random_sample))
mean(df%>%pull(vec_char))
mean(df%>%pull(vec_logical))
mean(df%>%pull(vec_factor))
```
When I try to apply mean function to these variables, only `r random_sample` and `r vec_logical ` work in this function and others show `r NA` in the output.

```{r setup,warning=FALSE}
as.numeric(df$vec_char)
as.numeric(df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
```
When I applies the `r as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor variables, vectors in `r vec_logical` and `r vec_factor` could converted to numeric but vectors in `r vec_char`still show `r NA` in the output. Vectors in `r vec_logical` can be `r True` or `r False`, which can be converted to 1 or 0, while `r vec_char` cannot convert to numeric directly.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
