The penguin dataset has  `r ncol(penguins)` columns and `r nrow(penguins)` rows. There are 8 variables in this dataset include `names(penguins)`. It records 3 kinds of penguins and they are `unique(penguins$species)`. They are from different islands include `unique(penguins$island)`. Their average flipper length is `mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)` mm. 


```{r}
plotp=ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
plotp
```
```{r}
ggsave("penguins scatter plot.pdf", plot=plotp)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
